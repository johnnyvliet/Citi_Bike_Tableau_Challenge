## Overview

This analysis was a demonstation of our skills in Tableau. We used rental bike data from NYC to pitch our start up's idea of bringing the concept to Des Moines. We used visualizations in Tableau to create a story to present to potential investors

## Results

Using 7 different visualizations - we were able to show investors very clearly what our findings were:
- The Manhattan area was where most of the rentals occured

- The evening hours are the most common time for rentals. The early morning is also the best time for maitenence considering the least number of rentals occur during these hours

- As expected, subscribers account for a greater density of rentals (compared to single riders). In other words - subscribtions are key for growing the business

- Men rent the most often, and the times at which they rent are quite consistent throughout the week

- Looking at the week as a whole - Thursday evenings are the most popular

- For males especially, as the number of rides increases, so do the times spent on the bikes

- Looking at this as a whole - the same trend is evident

## Summary

Our analysis shows that the ride sharing trend is very evident in New York City, and that our understanding of trends shows that we can copy this concept to be successful in Des Moines! It'll will be very important to target men and incentivise them to become subscribers. Knowing this is a good starting point at getting this business off the ground and on the road! Two additional visualizations I would like to do more research on:
1. How do start station densities differ by time and day? I would assume downtown rentals are more common after work hours during the weekday, where as parkside rentals are probably more common on weekends. This data could help support subscriber ad campaigns
2. Rider age and rental duration. Are the elderly long-haul riders with more free time? Or are millenials riding more on their way to work? Knowing the more profitable age group (who rides the longest) could also help target ad campaigns
